Iotop is a Python program with a top like UI used to show of behalf of which
process is the I/O going on. It requires Python >= 2.7 and a Linux kernel >=
2.6.20 with the CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT CONFIG_TASKSTATS,
CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING and CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS build options on
and for Linux kernels since 5.14, the kernel.task_delayacct sysctl enabled.


To run a local version of iotop:

$ ./iotop.py


The documentation is available in the man page:

$ man ./iotop.8


To install iotop, you should use a package provided by your distribution. If you
really want to install this version of iotop on your system, do (as root):

# ./setup.py install


For an alternative implementation of iotop that is written in C, uses
less resources and has more features, please take a look at this project:
